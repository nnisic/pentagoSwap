# pentagoSwap
Game-playing agent to play fictional "Pentago Swap" game. Majority of commits are from course TA defining various classes,
defining the random player, and creating the GUI for the game. My implementation was the strategy of the agent, namely
the functions chooseMove(), checkForWin(), evaluateBoardState(), abPruning(), maxNode(), & minNode(). These functions can be found at src/student_player/src/student_player/StudentPlayer.java.

# Launch GUI & Play Game
To launch the GUI, execute run the command 'java -cp bin boardgame.Server -p 8123 -t 300000' in the root directory of the project. To start playing, click Launch --> Launch human player and then Launch --> Launch client (student_player.StudentPlayer).
