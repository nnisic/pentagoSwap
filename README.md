# pentagoSwap
Game-playing agent to play fictional "Pentago Swap" game. Majority of commits are from course TA defining various classes,
defining the random player, and creating the GUI for the game. My implementation was the strategy of the agent, namely
the functions chooseMove(), checkForWin(), evaluateBoardState(), abPruning(), maxNode(), & minNode().
